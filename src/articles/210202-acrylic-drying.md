## Painting surface absorbency

Gesso usually absorbs paint, use GAG500 or molding paste to seal surface

## Humidity

Higher humidity increases the drying time. Try misting the canvas during the painting process and also misting the paints themselves

## Air Movement

Wind will dry out the paint quicker. So cover the pallette where you can and also stay out of the wind.

## Paint thickness

The thicker the paint the longer is will take to dry

## Temperature

A higher temperature decreases drying time so staying out of direct sunlight and also being in a cool room can help

## Mediums

Use something like Open Acrylic Medium(Gloss) to increase the drying time
